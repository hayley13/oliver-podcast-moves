# The Very Detailed Podcast Review

For this assignment, I decided to write a detailed review of the podcast **On Being with Krista Tippett**.  This podcast focuses on what it means to be human, or the art of being a human, and the spirituality or lack thereof that goes into it.  In each episode, Tippett hosts a prominent thinker or person concerned with or harboring a certain love for humanity, and discusses specific aspects and components of what it means to be human, a good human, in terms of the deep thoughts people have lost the knack of having, and the care and love people tend to feel less of for each other.

### The Episodes

For this assignment, I listened to three episodes:
* "The Inner Landscape of Beauty" with John O'Donohue
* "Soul Food, Sex, and Space" with Nikki Giovanni
* "Listening as an Act of Love" with David Isay

In each, Tippett discusses the titular subjects with these writers and thinkers, and talks with them about their own work and projects, their own lives - especially the ways in which they have found or define meaning for themselves.  Though the topics discussed - and thereby, the paths taken in the conversation to get at the significance of humanity and the meaning of life - vary, the organizational, stylistic, and narrative conventions used in each episode were quite the same.

#### Organization

The organization of each episode, or pattern present in each episode, is quite constant overall.  

1. Each episode would begin with a few seconds of background music that would lead to a quote from the guest, something they will come to say later in the interview.  This functions as an indirect introduction to the conversation.
2. Following this is a formal introduction by Tippett who explains what topic is being discussed, who she is discussing it with, and just what achievements or notable works give her guests the credentials to speak on said topics. 
3. Following this is the discussion about said topic, with moments of swelling music that lead to breaks in the conversation.  Occassionally, details about the topic of discussion and just who is discussing it with Tippett are reiterated during these moments.  Spoken advertisements happen less often as well.
4. Towards the end of each episode, thank are given, acknowledgements and credits are said, and one last tidbit from the guest - usually a tidbit from some of the work they are known for or that epitomizes them - is also given.  Background music plays all the while.

#### Style

The style of each episode is quite constant overall as well.  The only sounds present other than the voices of the host and guest was background music, which, though varied slightly from episode to episode, was nondescript, and did not take away or distract from the conversation at all.  The music mainly functioned as a way to provide a break from the conversation, like a breath taken after a long spiel.

#### Narrative Conventions

The narrative conventions used in each episode is also quite constant overall.  While the basis for each episode was an interview between the host and guest, it sounded less like an interview and more like a conversation.  There are distinct qualities present in each "conversation":
* Tippett began each interview/conversation by asking the guest to speak about their spiritual or religious background or experience growing up.  
* Tippett allowed - rather, encouraged - the guest to speak more than her, and so, more often than not, the guest did most of the speaking in each episode.
* Occassionally archival material was utilized to supplement the conversations, such as a recording of David Isay's conversation with his late father, and a recording of Nikki's powerful poetry reading after April 16th.  
* Each episode had to do with some of the essential aspects of what it means to be a human being.  Or rather, what it means to simply **be**.

### A Deeper Look at the Conversations, and Conclusion

* With David Isay, Tippett discusses the importance of listening to others, of being there for others, but being more than quiet.  People just want to listen, and love, and people just want to be heard.  Isay facilitates this with Story Corps, which allows people to enter a sacred place and talk with a a friend, family member, or loved one, uninhibited, free from restraint or censorship or judgment, in a forty minute session. 
* With Nikki Giovanni, Tippett listens as Nikki discusses her dreams of humans going to Mars, of the difference between poetry and novels, of persevering through April 16th, of the Black experience and the strength, love, and vision that inevitably accompany that notion.  
* With John O'Donohue, Tippett discusses the importance of having beauty in one's life, with originates both from without and within the self.  They discuss the importance of knowing what true beauty is an where to find it, how to recognize it.  They also discuss the idea of the soul, teh eternally untouchable bits of it, and its relation to time, or time spent wisely.

I highly recommend this podcast.  Especially the conversation with our own Nikki Giovanni, who is an absolute gem.  This podcast is, in short, about how to be a better human being.
