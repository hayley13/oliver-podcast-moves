# The Very Detailed Podcast Review

For this assignment, I decided to write a detailed review of the podcast ****On Being with Krista Tippett****.  This podcast focuses on what it means to be human, or the art of being a human, and the spirituality or lack thereof that goes into it.  In each episode, Tippett hosts a prominent thinker or person concerned with or harboring a certain love for humanity, and discusses specific aspects and components of what it means to be human, a good human, in terms of the deep thoughts people have lost the knack of having, and the care and love people tend to feel less of for each other.

### The Episodes

For this assignment, I listened to three episodes:
* "The Inner Landscape of Beauty" with John O'Donohue
* "Soul Food, Sex, and Space" with Nikki Giovanni
* "Listening as an Act of Love" with David Isay

In each, Tippett discusses the titular subjects with these writers and thinkers, and talks with them about their own work and projects, their own lives - especially the ways in which they have found or define meaning for themselves.  Though the topics discussed - and thereby, the paths taken in the conversation to get at the significance of humanity and the meaning of life - vary, the organization, style, and narrative types used in each episode were quite the same.

#### Organization

The organization of each episode, or pattern present in each episode, was quite constant overall.  
1. Each episode would begin with a few seconds of background music that would lead to a quote from the guest, something they will come to say later in the interview.  This functions as an indirect introduction to the conversation.
2. Following this is a formal introduction by Tippett who explains what topic is being discussed, who she is discussing it with, and just what achievements or notable works give her guests the credentials to speak on said topics. 
3. Following this is the discussion about said topic, with moments of swelling music that lead to breaks in the conversation.  Occassionally, details about the topic of discussion and just who is discussing it with Tippett are reiterated during these moments.  Spoken advertisements happen less often as well.
4. Towards the end of each episode, thank are given, acknowledgements and credits are said, and one last tidbit from the guest - usually a tidbit from some of the work they are known for or that epitomizes them - is also given.  Background music plays all the while.
